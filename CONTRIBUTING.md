## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Add proper type definitions
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use meaningful variable names

```typescript
// ✅ Good
interface UserData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

async function fetchUser(userId: string): Promise<UserData> {
  // ...
}

// ❌ Not So Good
async function fetch(id) {
  // ...
}
```

### Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Update tests for bug fixes
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

```typescript
// ✅ Good
describe('fetchAPI', () => {
  it('should handle successful API responses', async () => {
    // ...
  });

  it('should handle network errors gracefully', async () => {
    // ...
  });
});
